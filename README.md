Question 1: Controlled Multiplication Loop
This program multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product becomes greater than a specified threshold value. It keeps track of the current multiplier and prints both the final product and the integer that caused the threshold to be exceeded.

Question 2: Nested Dictionary from Strings
This function takes a list of strings and returns a dictionary where each string is a key. The corresponding value is another dictionary that stores the string’s length and whether the length is even or odd.

Question 3: Safe Function Application
This question defines a function to compute 𝑥^𝑦. A list of (x, y) pairs is processed using a loop with argument unpacking. Any pair with a negative exponent is skipped, and valid results are stored and printed.

Question 4: Sorted Search with Conditions
This program generates a list of random numbers and a random value x. The list is sorted, and all values greater than or equal to x are identified. The program prints the sorted list, the value of x, and the index of the first matching value, if one exists.

Question 5: Circle Area Comparison with Validation
This function accepts the radii of two circles and validates that both inputs are positive integers. If valid, it calculates each circle’s area and returns the percentage of the larger circle’s area that can be covered by the smaller circle. If the input is invalid, a meaningful error message is returned.

Question 6: Distribution Analysis
This function analyzes a list of numbers and returns a dictionary where each key is a unique number from the list. Each value represents the percentage of elements in the list that are less than or equal to that key. The dictionary is sorted by key before being returned.

Question 7: Time Conversion Function
This function converts a number of seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. It returns the result as a formatted string or an appropriate error message if the input is invalid.

Question 8: Pandas DataFrame with Computed Column
This question uses the pandas library to create a DataFrame from provided data. A new column is added that is derived from existing columns, and the final DataFrame is printed.
